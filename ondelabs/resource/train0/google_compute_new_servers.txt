Google today announced that it has launched two new Compute Engine zones: one in the U.S. (us-central1-f) and one in Asia (asia-east1-c). Google says this will make it easier for developers to run systems like MongoDB and others that use a quorum-based architecture for high availability by working across multiple data centers. The new zone will run servers based on Intelâ€™s Ivy Bridge processors, while the two other U.S. zones Google already offers will use older Sandy Bridge-based machines.
