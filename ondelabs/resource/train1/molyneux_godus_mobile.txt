Wacky game creator Peter Molyneux took to Kickstarter to fund the development of Godus, a god sim and Populous spiritual successor designed for mobile back in 2012. Now, after an early access launch late last year, itâ€™s finally available to all for free on the App Store. The iPhone and iPad-optimized game lets you experience the joy of creation and the enthralling sting of destruction as you raise lands and civilizations, and should generally let you encourage your delusions of grandeur.
