Last September, Google launched Web Designer, a free tool for Mac,
Windows and Linux that makes it easy for anybody to build interactive
HTML5 sites and ads. Since its launch, Web Designer got a couple of
minor updates, but todayâ€™s release is the first major update in a
long time and brings quite a few new features to the software.
