Apple is said to be preparing for a September 9 iPhone event this year,
at which we’ll likely see the next generation iPhone devices, according
to Re/Code’s John Paczkowski. The date would be in keeping with past
iPhone launches, and early reports suggest we’ll see the company reveal
larger-screened iPhone devices on that day.
